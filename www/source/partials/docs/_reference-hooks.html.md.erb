# <a name="reference-hooks" id="reference-hooks" data-magellan-target="reference-hooks">Hooks</a>
Each plan can specify lifecycle event handlers, or hooks, to perform certain actions during a service's runtime. Each hook is a script with a [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) defined at the top to specify the interpreter to be used. On Windows, Powershell Core is the only interpreter ever used.

To define a hook, simply create a bash file of the same name in `/my_plan_name/hooks/`, for example, `/postgresql/hooks/health-check`.

> **Important** You cannot block the thread in a hook unless it is in the `run` hook. Never call `hab` or `sleep` in a hook that is not the `run` hook.

[Habitat's runtime settings](/docs/reference#template-data) can be used in any of the plan hooks and also in any templatized configuration file for your application or service.

> Note: In habitat 0.68.0 and less, some hooks used `_` in their names. This is now deprecated; if you used them, please use `-` instead.

###file-updated
File location: `<plan>/hooks/file-updated`

This hook is run whenever a configuration file that is not related to a user or about the state of the service instances is updated.

###health-check
File location: `<plan>/hooks/health-check`

This hook is run when the Habitat HTTP API receives a request at `/health`.

The `health-check` script must return a valid exit code from the list below.

  - **0**- ok
  - **1**- warning
  - **2**- critical
  - **3**- unknown
  - any other code - failed health check with additional output taken from `health-check` stdout.

A `health-check` hook can use the following as a template:

```bash hooks/health-check
#!/bin/sh

# define default return code as 0
rc=0
program_that_returns_a_status
case $? in
  0)
    rc=1 ;;
  3)
    rc=0 ;;
  4)
    rc=2 ;;
  *)
    rc=3 ;;
esac

exit $rc
```

###init
File location: `<plan>/hooks/init`

This hook is run when a Habitat topology starts.

###install
File location: `<plan>/hooks/install`

This hook is run when a package is initially installed. An `install` hook may be triggered by `hab pkg install` or by a Supervisor loading a new package. Note that any package can define an `install` hook and it is not limited to packages that are loaded as services into a Supervisor. A package may have dependencies defined in `pkg_deps` or `pkg_build_deps` that define their own `install` hook. An `install` hook defined in an dependant package that has not yet been installed will run when the parent package is instaled. However `install` hooks in a runtime dependancy (`pkg_deps`) will not run when loaded via a package `build` inside of a Studio.

The exit code returned from an `install` hook will be "remembered". If a previously installed package is either installed again via `hab pkg install` or loaded into a Supervisor, its `install` hook will be rerun if it previously failed (exited with a non `0` result).

An `install` hook, unlike other hooks, will not have access to any census data exposed via binds or the `svc` namespace. Also, configuration in `svc_config_path` is not accesible to an `install` hook. If an `install` hook needs to utilize templated configuration files, templates located in the `svc_config_install_path` may be referenced. This location will contain rendered templates in a package's `config_install` folder. Finally, any configuration updates made during a service's runtime that would alter an `install` hook or any configuration template in `svc_config_install_path` will not cause a service to reload.

Currently, the `install` hook is only functional when the `INSTALL_HOOK` feature flag is enabled. It is disabled by default. To enable it, set the `HAB_FEAT_INSTALL_HOOK` environment variable to any value.

###reload
File location: `<plan>/hooks/reload`

For processes that can update their configuration without requiring a restart a `reload` hook can be written. This hook will execute instead of the default behaviour of restarting the process. `{{pkg.svc_pid_file}}` can be used to get a handle on the `PID` of the service.

###reconfigure
File location: `<plan>/hooks/reconfigure`

This hook is run when service configuration has changed due to updates coming from the gossip protocol or from the `user.toml` file. Before the `reconfigure` hook the config files are re-rendered and the process is either restarted or the `reload` hook is called if present.

###suitability
File location: `<plan>/hooks/suitability`

The suitability hook allows a service to report a priority by which it should be elected leader. The hook is called when a new election is triggered and the last line it outputs to `stdout` should be a number parsable as a `u64`. In the event that a leader goes down and an election is started the service with the highest reported suitabilty will become the new leader.

###run
File location: `<plan>/hooks/run`

This hook is run when one of the following conditions occur:

  - The main topology starts, after the `init` hook has been called.
  - When a package is updated, after the `init` hook has been called.
  - When the package config changes, after the `init` hook has been called, but before a `reconfigure` hook is called.

You can use this hook in place of `$pkg_svc_run` when you need more complex behavior such as setting environment variables or command options that are based on dynamic configuration.

Services run using this hook should do two things:

  - Redirect stderr to stdout (e.g. with `exec 2>&1` at the start of the hook)
  - Call the command to execute with `exec <command> <options>` rather than running the command directly. This ensures the command is executed in the same process and that the service will restart correctly on configuration changes.

It is important to also consider what side effects the command to execute will have. For example, does the command spin off other processes in separate process groups? If so, they may not be cleaned up automatically when the system is reconfigured. In general, the command executed should behave in a manner similar to a daemon, and be able to clean up properly after itself when it receives a SIGTERM, and properly forward signals to other processes that it creates. For an even more specific example: let's say you are trying to start a node.js service. Instead of your command being `npm start`, you should use `node server.js` directly.

A run hook can use the following as a template:

```bash hooks/run
#!/bin/sh

# redirect stderr
exec 2>&1

# Set some environment variables
export MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE=1
export MY_OTHER_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE=2

# Run the command
exec my_command --option {{cfg.option}} --option2 {{cfg.option2}}
```

###post-run
File location: `<plan>/hooks/post-run`

The post run hook will get executed after initial startup.

For many data services creation of specific users / roles or datastores is required. This needs to happen once the service has already started.

###post-stop
File location: `<plan>/hooks/post-stop`

The post-stop hook will get executed after service has been stopped successfully.

You may use this hook to undo what the `init` hook has done.
